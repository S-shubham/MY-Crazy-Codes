// I was coding for an online platform and my program was supposed to take input from the platform
// the input was in lines and after the end of each line there was a new line statement
// so to test how it woudl behave if I ignore this note and simply go ahead and take input in traditional way

#include<iostream>
#include<string>
using namespace std;

int main()
{
	string first,second;
	cin>>first;
	cin>>second;
	cout<<"\n Frist string is : "<<first;
	cout<<"\nSecond stirng is : "<<second;
	// newline is working fine bcoz as soon as cin encounters newline it move on to take new input
}
