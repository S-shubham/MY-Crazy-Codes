Program to find the index at which an element is supposed to be inserted in a sorted array
time complexity is O(logn)

// A binary search based function to find the position
// where item should be inserted in a[low..high]
int binarySearch(int a[], int item, int low, int high)
{
    if (high <= low)
        return (item > a[low])?  (low + 1): low;
 
    int mid = (low + high)/2;
 
    if(item == a[mid])
        return mid+1;
 
    if(item > a[mid])
        return binarySearch(a, item, mid+1, high);
    return binarySearch(a, item, low, mid-1);
}
