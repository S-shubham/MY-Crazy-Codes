Before you write code, write all the test cases that you can think of and only after that you write code

first you need to have a clear understanding of what you are doing
you need to take couple of examples and then go on to test those for the evaluation 
At the end once you have understood all the corner cases then only move on to write code

this way you ensure that you have written a good code and you will not have to modify it a lot
