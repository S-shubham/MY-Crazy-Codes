C++ has buffered I/O operation
For the below mentioed program if we input "12D34" to an integer var it will discared the values from D onwards and it will be still sotred
in the buffer which will cause next input to take the discarded value. This will definitely have unintended effect on your program. so 
flushing the output buffer is a must
......................................................

// program to test how buffered  I/O can have unintended effects on our program
#include<bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int main()
{
	int a;
	char c;
	cin>>a;
	cin>>c;
	cout<<"the number is : "<<a;
	cout<<"\nthe character is : "<<c;
}

In order to get rid of this problem we need to flush the input buffer after taking inputs

// program to test how buffered  I/O can have unintended effects on our program
#include<bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int main()
{
	int a;
	char c;
	cin>>a;
  fflush(stdin);
	cin>>c;
	cout<<"the number is : "<<a;
	cout<<"\nthe character is : "<<c;
}
